    A[Start] --> B[Load Configuration]
    B --> C[Load Invoice Data]
    C --> D[Validate Data Structure]
    D --> E[Clean & Process Data]
    E --> F[Generate Reports]
    F --> G[Send Email Notifications]
    G --> H[Log Results]
    H --> I[End]
    
    D --> J[Validation Failed]
    J --> K[Error Notification]
    K --> I
```

### 3.2 Detailed Process Steps

#### Step 1: Data Ingestion and Validation

  - Date parsing and validation
- **Quality Checks:**
  - Duplicate detection and removal
  - Outlier identification (amounts > $50,000)
  - Date range validation (not future dates)
- **Output:** Clean, standardized dataset

#### Step 3: Business Logic Application
- **Calculations:**
  - Age of invoice (days since creation)
  - Amount categorization (Small, Medium, Large, Enterprise)
  - Overdue flag (>30 days unpaid)
  - Client risk scoring
- **Enrichment:**
  - Addition of calculated fields
  - Historical trend analysis
  - Client segmentation

#### Step 4: Report Generation
- **Multiple Formats:**
  - Detailed Excel report with multiple sheets
  - Executive summary PDF
  - CSV exports for data warehouse
- **Content:**
  - Summary statistics and KPIs
  - Client-wise breakdown
  - Status distribution analysis
  - Aging analysis
  - Top clients by volume/amount
  - Overdue invoice alerts

#### Step 5: Distribution and Notification
- **Email Reports:**
  - HTML formatted emails with embedded charts
  - Excel attachments with detailed data
  - Mobile-friendly responsive design
- **Recipients:**
  - Finance team (detailed reports)
  - Management (executive summaries)
  - Account managers (client-specific reports)
